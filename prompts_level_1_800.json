Movement should only be done if it is requested in the prompt.\nFirst, here is the complete state of all objects on the grid of size 5x5 (0 based indexing) with coordinates on x-axis increases in east direction and coordinates on y-axis increases in north direction:\n- Object 'Cat1' is at position (0,0).\n- Object 'Man1' is at position (0,3).\n- Object 'Car1' is at position (1,2).\n- Object 'Dog1' is at position (2,2).\n- Object 'Child1' is at position (2,3).\n- Object 'Horse1' is at position (3,0).\n- Object 'Dog3' is at position (3,1).\n- Object 'Bike1' is at position (3,3).\n- Object 'Bike2' is at position (3,4).\n- Object 'Train1' is at position (4,1).\n- Object 'Plane1' is at position (4,2).\n- Object 'Dog2' is at position (4,3).\n\n--- MOVEMENT RULES ---\n1. Movement should not cross the grid boundaries. It must always remain inside the grid.\n2. If after completion of the movement, the new position of the agent is already occupied by another object, that move is invalid.\n3. All mentioned actions must be performed in sequence. If any action results in a failure (due to rule 1 or 2), you must stop the process immediately and your only response should be the exact phrase: incorrect prompt\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nIf the action sequence is valid, your answer must be only one of the 8 primary directions: Left, Right, Behind, In-Front, Behind-Left, In-Front-Left, Behind-Right, or In-Front-Right. Your answer should be given right at the end of your response, immediately in the form \u201c###Answer:"
