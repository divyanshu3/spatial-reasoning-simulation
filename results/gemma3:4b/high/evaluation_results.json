Reversing direction on the spot means facing South.\n\nSo, Cat1's final position is (4,0) and is facing South.\n\nNow, let's determine Dog1's location: Dog1 is at (2,2) facing South.\n\nTo find the direction from Cat1's perspective, we need to consider the relative positions. Cat1 is at (4,0) facing South, and Dog1 is at (2,2) facing South. They are both facing South. This means that to go from Cat1 to Dog1, Cat1 needs to move 2 steps to the Right, and 2 steps Down. Since Cat1 is facing South, it will always be moving toward the direction of South.\n\nConsidering the final positions: Cat1 at (4,0) facing South, Dog1 at (2,2) facing South. This means Dog1 is to the Right and Below of Cat1.\n\n###Answer: Right",
