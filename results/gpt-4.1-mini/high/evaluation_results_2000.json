So (2,1) is free now.\n- No other object occupies (2,1).\n- So moving one step to the front (south) onto (2,1) is valid.\n\n- After step 6: Bike1 is at (2,1) facing South.\n\n7. Shift one cell to the Left: Facing South, Left means East, so shift one cell east: (3,1).\n- Check if (3,1) is occupied: Not occupied by any object.\n- So after step 7: Bike1 is at (3,1) facing South.\n\nNow, from Bike1's final perspective at (3,1) facing South, locate Horse1 at (1,1).\n\nLet's find the relative direction:\n\n- Relative positions:\n\nBike1 at (3,1) facing South.\n\nHorse1 at (1,1).\n\n- Calculate relative vector from Bike1 to Horse1: (1 - 3, 1 - 1) = (-2,0)\n\nThis vector means two steps to the west, same latitude.\n\nFacing South: coordinate changes are -\n- \"In-Front\" is in the south direction, i.e. y decreases by 1.\n- \"Behind\" is north, y increases by 1.\n- \"Left\" is to the east, x increases by 1.\n- \"Right\" is west, x decreases by 1.\n\nGiven this, the positive x-axis is East, positive y-axis is North.\n\nBike1 faces South (negative y direction).\n\nFrom the agent's perspective:\n\n- Left: East (positive x)\n- Right: West (negative x)\n- In-Front: South (negative y)\n- Behind: North (positive y)\n\nHorse1 is at (-2, 0) relative to Bike1, which means two steps to the right from agent's perspective.\n\nHence, the target is directly Right.\n\n###Answer: Right",

Child1 performs two 90-degree turns to the Left:\n   - First turn left from East \u2192 North.\n   - Second turn left from North \u2192 West.\n   So, Child1 is now facing West.\n\n3. Now, from Child1's position (4,2), facing West, we determine where Cat2 (2,4) is relative to this new perspective:\n   - The vector from Child1 to Cat2 is (2 - 4, 4 - 2) = (-2, 2).\n   - Facing West means the \"In-Front\" direction corresponds to decreasing x.\n   - The \"Left\" direction corresponds to increasing y.\n   - The \"Right\" direction corresponds to decreasing y.\n   - The \"Behind\" direction corresponds to increasing x.\n\n4. The vector (-2, 2) can be decomposed relative to the facing direction (West):\n   - x-difference: -2 (means 2 units ahead since facing West means in-front is negative x-direction)\n   - y-difference: 2 (means 2 units to the left)\n\nTherefore, Cat2 is located \"In-Front-Left\" from Child1's new perspective.\n\n###Answer: In-Front-Left",

Man1's facing:\n\n- Absolute angle to Cat2: 75.96\u00b0 north of East\n- Man1 faces North (90\u00b0), so the angle difference is:\n\nangle relative to Man1 = absolute direction - Man1's facing\n= 75.96\u00b0 (from East) - 90\u00b0 (from East)\n= -14.04\u00b0\n\nThis means the target is 14.04\u00b0 to the right of Man1's forward direction (since negative angle here means east of north, i.e., right side).\n\nNow, let\u2019s define the primary directions relative to Man1's facing (North):\n\n- In-Front: 0\u00b0\n- In-Front-Right: 45\u00b0\n- Right: 90\u00b0\n- Behind-Right: 135\u00b0\n- Behind: 180\u00b0\n- Behind-Left: 225\u00b0\n- Left: 270\u00b0\n- In-Front-Left: 315\u00b0\n\nOur angle is approximately -14\u00b0, which is close to 0\u00b0, and around 15\u00b0 right of 0\u00b0. This falls within the range of \"In-Front\" because it is within \u00b122.5\u00b0 of forward.\n\nSince -14.04\u00b0 is closer to In-Front (0\u00b0) than to In-Front-Right (45\u00b0) or Right (90\u00b0), the target is essentially In-Front of Man1.\n\n###Answer: In-Front",

Turn 90 degrees to the Right.  \n    - Facing North -> now facing East\n\n14. Face the direction on their Right.  \n    - Facing East -> now facing South\n\nFinal position of Child1: (4,3)\nFinal facing direction of Child1: South\n\nHorse2 position: (3,2)\n\nNow, let's locate Horse2 relative to Child1 at (4,3) facing South.\n\nCoordinate differences:\n- \u0394x = 3 - 4 = -1 (Horse2 is one step west)\n- \u0394y = 2 - 3 = -1 (Horse2 is one step south)\n\nFacing South means:\n- In-front is (4,2)\n- Behind is (4,4)\n- Left is (3,3)\n- Right is (5,3) (outside grid, but we use this only for direction determination)\n  \nHorse2 is one step west and one step south from Child1, relative to Child1 facing south:\n\n- South is in-front\n- West is to the right when facing south (because south is down, west is right)\n\nSo the target is in front-right diagonal.\n\nHence, Horse2 is In-Front-Right relative to Child1.\n\n###Answer: In-Front-Right",
