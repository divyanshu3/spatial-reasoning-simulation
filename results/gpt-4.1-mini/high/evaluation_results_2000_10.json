Plane3 moves three steps to the Front (South).\n- New position: (2,3 - 3) = (2,0)\nBut the grid's y-axis increases northward, so moving south decreases y coordinate. \nMoving 3 steps south from (2,3) results in (2,0).\n- Checking if the position is occupied: (2,0) is not occupied by any object.\n\n2. Plane3 shifts one cell to the Right.\n- Facing South, the Right direction is West (left on x-axis), so x decreases by 1.\n- New position: (2 - 1, 0) = (1,0)\n- Check if (1,0) is occupied: It is not occupied.\n\n3. Plane3 turns 90 degrees to the Left.\n- Facing South, turning left means facing East.\n\nNow, from Plane3's new position (1,0) and facing East, we need to find the direction of Cow4 at (0,6).\n\nCalculate relative position:\n- Difference in x: 0 - 1 = -1\n- Difference in y: 6 - 0 = 6\n\nIn a coordinate system facing East (x-positive), directions are:\n- In-Front: positive x, same y (x > 0, y = 0)\n- Behind: negative x, same y (x < 0, y = 0)\n- Left: same x, positive y (x = 0, y > 0)\n- Right: same x, negative y (x = 0, y < 0)\n\nBut here, since y is positive and x is negative, Cow4 is to the left and in front-left positions.\n\nCalculate angle more intuitively:\n\nFacing East, the positive x-axis is front.\n\nTo transform the global coordinates to agent-centric coordinates:\n\nAgent facing East means:\n- Front: +x direction\n- Left: +y direction\n- So, relative x' = difference in x\n- relative y' = difference in y\n\nWait, but initial difference is:\ndx = Target_x - Agent_x = 0 - 1 = -1\ndy = Target_y - Agent_y = 6 - 0 = 6\n\nBut this is in global coordinates, so relative to East facing agent,\n\nFront is +x, Left is +y.\n\nSo, relative_front = dx = -1 (so behind)\nrelative_left = dy = 6 (left)\n\nSo, target is 1 unit behind and 6 units to the left.\n\nSo the target direction relative to the agent is Behind-Left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Behind-Left.\n\n###Answer: Behind-Left",

The relative directions in a coordinate system where y increases North and x increases East are:\n\n- Front: South (y decreases)\n- Behind: North (y increases)\n- Left: East (x increases)\n- Right: West (x decreases)\n\nBut we have to express the target's relative position from Car5's perspective (facing South).\n\nRelative x-axis (left-right from Car5's perspective):\n- Left: +x (East)\n- Right: -x (West)\n\nRelative y-axis (front-behind from Car5's perspective):\n- Front: -y (South)\n- Behind: +y (North)\n\nRelative coordinates after Car5's facing south adjustment:\n\nDisplacement vector is (-2, -2) in grid coordinates:\n- x = -2 (West)\n- y = -2 (South)\n\nFrom Car5's perspective facing South:\n- x negative means Right\n- y negative means Front\n\nSo the target is to the Front-Right direction.\n\n###Answer: In-Front-Right",

Child3 turns 90 degrees left (from East) \u2192 facing North.\n4. Child3 moves one step to the left (from current orientation North, left is West) \u2192 moves from (1,0) to (0,0).\n   - This is a valid move since (0,0) is unoccupied.\n5.
