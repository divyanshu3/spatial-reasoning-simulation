(Valid: not occupied.)\n- Step 2: (1,3) to (2,3).\n- (2,3) is **Cat1's original position**, but is it now occupied? Let's check the current grid after Cat1 has vacated it:\n    - Cat1 left (2,3) at step 1, no other object moved there.\n    - So, (2,3) is now unoccupied.\n- Move is valid.\n\n**Now at:** (2,3), facing South.\n\n---\n\n## Final Agent Position:\n- Cat1 is at (2,3), facing South.\n\n## Target Position:\n- Dog1 at (0,2).\n\n---\n\n### Calculate the direction to Dog1 from Cat1's final position and facing:\n\nCat1 at (2,3), facing South.\n\n- Dog1 at (0,2).\n\nLet\u2019s express the relative position:\n\n- Cat1 x=2, y=3. Dog1 x=0, y=2.\n- \u0394x = 0 - 2 = -2 (West)\n- \u0394y = 2 - 3 = -1 (South)\n\nBut Cat1 is facing South: we need to translate the relative grid direction into Cat1\u2019s local directions.\n\nWhen facing South:\n- In-Front: negative Y (down on grid, i.e., lower y)\n- Right: positive X (East)\n- Left: negative X (West)\n- Behind: positive Y (up on grid, i.e., higher y)\n\nFrom (2,3) facing South,  the grid directions translate as:\n- \"Grid West\" (\u0394x negative) = Agent\u2019s Left.\n- \"Grid South\" (\u0394y negative) = Agent\u2019s In-Front.\n\nSo \u0394x = -2 (Left), \u0394y = -1 (In-Front).\n\nThus, Dog1 is to the In-Front-Left for Cat1.\n\n###Answer: In-Front-Left",

(4,2) is unoccupied (since we left it), so okay.\n- Step 2: (4,2) \u2192 (4,3) (increase y by 1).

For South:\n- Local \"In-Front\": (0, -1)\n- Local \"Left\": (+1, 0)\n- Local \"Right\": (-1,0)\n- Diagonal movements are combinations.\n\nSo, dx = -1 (right), dy = -1 (in front)\n\nThus, relative to South-facing:\n- (-1, -1) is In-Front-Right\n\n###Answer: In-Front-Right",
